# Spotify_Music_Analysis

## Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Spotify music data across 952 tracks. The goal is to uncover patterns in **streaming behavior**, **audio features**, and **release strategies** to inform **growth and content decisions**‚Äîideal for roles focused on data-driven music strategy.

## Problem Statement
With thousands of songs released daily, it's challenging to identify what makes certain tracks outperform others in terms of streams and listener engagement. Platforms like Spotify need to understand how factors like release timing, audio characteristics, and chart or playlist presence influence a song's success. Without these insights, optimizing release strategies and curating content for growth becomes guesswork.The insights are intended to support playlist optimization, release planning, and user engagement strategies for music platforms like Spotify.
